In this case we want to compute the statistical population for three 
statistical indicators:
the correlation coefficient R2
the mean-unsigned-error MUE
and the Kendall tau 
for a list of "computed values" over "real values"

In this case it is interesting to notice that we have to know which is the best
way to implement the C code.
As a matter of fact the Kendall tau is not optimized, namely it is not using 
a mergesort algorithm, thus for "computed values" list with more than 50 items
the computation will be quite expensive.

c_code: main routine written in C
confidence.py : Python script to call the Cython code
experimental.csv and predictions.csv : list of "real values" and "computed values"
Makefile : make file to compile the Cython code
perturb.c : compiled Cython code
perturb.pyx: Cython code
perturb.so: dynamic library, which can be imported in Python
