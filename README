Cython: the best of both worlds

Cython mixes C and Python together, to give oyu an overall speed up and improvement
of your code.
Here I am showing some examples on how to use it:

- points_in_rect: in this case we are generating random points and measure if they are within
                  or out N rectangles

- confidence_test: here we are computing the population for R2, mean-unsigned-error and Kendall tau for a list of 
                  values, compared to "real" values, by bootstrapping
